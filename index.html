<p id="what-you-need">This short guide covers a few things that are good to know when you are new to the Mac. If you've got the latest version of OS X installed, 10.9, Mavericks, then you are all set to go. If you have an older version, you should upgrade before continuing. You can get the free upgrade to Mavericks in the Mac App Store.</p>
